As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or e-mail address,), and information about that individual’s location or activities or demographic information when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collection. Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site. We may collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us.

We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Information we collect may be combined with the information we obtained through other services we offer.
